# **My Project - Movies Database**


## **Overview**
The app allows users to view movie information including a trailer, but also be able to comment and leave a rating on a chosen movie, whilst being able to view other users' comments.

A user can also upload their own movie and create a listing with the required information. They can also edit their own moview and delete them if needed.

To allow a user to find movies quicker, categories are pre-built.

## **Approach**
My approach was to split back end and front end completely, so that back end was to be created first and then work on front end.

First of all I planned how the app should function and what the user should be able to see and do. 

Then created user stories and wireframes to reflect this.

The next step was to plan the back end and what models and fields would be required at front end.

## **Challenges**
The main challenges were first of all building the back end with Django, and also when using React for front end, dealing with fields validation errors.
